## Problem 1

``` r
#set up the packages and the dataset
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
data("early_january_weather")
```

From the help document, we can see that:

This is an hourly meterological data for LGA, JFK and EWR for the month
of January 2013 and a subset of the `weather` data frame from
`nycflights13`.

**1. the variables in this dataset:**

The variables in the dataset `early_january_weather` are: origin, year,
month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust,
precip, pressure, visib, time_hour.

Below is the explanation of the meanings of the variables:

**origin:** Weather station. Named origin to facilitate merging with
nycflights13::flights data.

**year, month, day, hour:** Time of recording.

**temp, dewp:** Temperature and dewpoint in F.

**humid:** Relative humidity.

**wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust:** Wind direction (in degrees), speed
and gust speed (in mph).

**precip:** Precipitation, in inches.

**pressure:** Sea level pressure in millibars.

**visib:** Visibility in miles.

**time_hour:** Date and hour of the recording as a POSIXct date

**2. the size of the dataset (using nrow and ncol):**

This dataset has **358 rows** and **15 columns**.

**3. the mean temperature:**

The mean temperature is **39.5821229 F**.

``` r
#create the scatterplot
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y= temp, color=humid)) + 
geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_rl3401_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
#save the scatterplot
ggsave("scatter1.png")
```

This scatterplot shows the relationship between `time_hour` on the
**x-axis** and `temperature` on the **y-axis**, with the **color** of
the points based on the `humidity`.

From the plot, it appears that as `time_hour` increases, there is a
general tendency for both `temperature` and `humidity` to increase.

## Problem 2

``` r
#create the dataframe
hw1_df <- tibble(
  random_sample = rnorm(10),
  logical_vector = random_sample > 0, 
  character_vector = c("R", "L", "3", "4", "0", "1", "_", "H", "W", "1"),  
  factor_vector = factor(rep(c("Level 1", "Level 2", "Level 3"),length = 10), levels = c("Level 1", "Level 2", "Level 3"))
)
```

``` r
#show the dataframe
print(hw1_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 Ã— 4
    ##    random_sample logical_vector character_vector factor_vector
    ##            <dbl> <lgl>          <chr>            <fct>        
    ##  1       -1.45   FALSE          R                Level 1      
    ##  2        1.60   TRUE           L                Level 2      
    ##  3        0.0273 TRUE           3                Level 3      
    ##  4       -0.886  FALSE          4                Level 1      
    ##  5       -0.196  FALSE          0                Level 2      
    ##  6        2.13   TRUE           1                Level 3      
    ##  7       -0.986  FALSE          _                Level 1      
    ##  8       -0.171  FALSE          H                Level 2      
    ##  9       -0.665  FALSE          W                Level 3      
    ## 10        2.39   TRUE           1                Level 1

``` r
#calculate the mean of each variable
mean(pull(hw1_df,random_sample))
```

    ## [1] 0.1793701

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df,logical_vector))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df,character_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, character_vector)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df,factor_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, factor_vector)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

As shown above, the means of the `random sample` and the
`logical factor` **can be calculated**, while the means of the
`character vector` and the `factor vector` **can not be calculated**.

``` r
mean(as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,logical_vector)))
mean(as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,character_vector)))
mean(as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,factor_vector)))
```

1.  For the `logical vector`, the logical value TRUE is represented as
    1, while FALSE is represented as 0.

    When the `as.numeric() function` is used, it returns the numerical
    values of 0 and 1 corresponding to the logical values.

2.  It is not possible to calculate the mean of a character variable in
    R.

    When the `as.numeric() function` is applied to the
    `character vector`, R is unable to convert the character data type
    to a numeric data type, resulting in NA.

3.  Finding the mean of a factor variable is also impossible.

    When the `as.numeric() function` is used on the `factor vector`, R
    assigns numerical values of 1, 2, 3 to each level of the factor
    variable and the mean can be calculated.
